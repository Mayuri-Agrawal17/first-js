<!-- bind() in JavaScript üìù

The bind() method is used to permanently attach a specific this value to a function and optionally preset arguments.
It does NOT run the function immediately, it just returns a new copy of the function with the fixed this. 

Why we need bind:
Sometimes, when you pass a method around, it loses its original this, causing bugs.
bind() solves this by locking this to the value you want.


when event handler methods like handleClick lost their reference to the class instance.

Solution: Use the bind() method to explicitly bind this so that the event handler has access to class properties and methods.-->

        const button = document.querySelector("button");

        // Attach event listener with bind
        button.addEventListener("click", this.handleClick.bind(this));  //.bind(this) creates a new version of handleClick where 
        // this is permanently attached to the class instance.

        /*if we donot use bind here then 
        When the button is clicked:
        ‚úÖ "Button Clicked!" appears in the console.
        ‚ùå this.server ‚Üí undefined.

        When we pass this.handleClick directly to addEventListener, this changes context.
        Inside handleClick, this no longer refers to the class instance, instead it refers to the button element.
        This is why this.server gives undefined.*/
