var accountPassword="123465se"//  We don’t prefer var in JavaScript because it can be confusing —
//  it doesn't follow block rules (like inside {}), so it works outside the block too,
// which can cause unexpected results, unlike let and const which stay only inside the block where they're declared.

//accountId=2 //not allowed as this valuse is contant and we connot change constant value
accountEmail="mayurii@gmail.com"
accountPassword="134679"

console.log(accountId)
console.table([accountId,accountEmail,accountPassword,accountCity,accountState]) //to print everything in one go and in a table formate
//console.table() only works with arrays or objects, so wrapping a string like "mayuri@gmail.com" in [] turns it into a valid array and makes it work.
