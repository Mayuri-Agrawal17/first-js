<!-- --------------------DOM

DOM stands for Document Object Model.
It is NOT part of JavaScript itself.
The browser automatically creates the DOM when a webpage loads.
DOM represents your entire webpage as a tree-like structure, where each element is a node (object).

Simple Definition:
DOM is a bridge between HTML and JavaScript that allows JS to interact with, read, and change the webpage dynamically. 



Why DOM is Needed?

Without the DOM, JavaScript cannot see or change what’s written in HTML.

DOM acts like an API that JavaScript uses to:--
Read elements (like <h1>, <p>, <div>)
Modify content, attributes, or styles
Add or remove elements dynamically
Handle user actions like clicks, keypress, etc-->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>DOM Learning</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="bg-black">
        <h1 class="heading">"dom learing from chai or code</h1>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    </div>

</html>

<!-- DOM Tree Structure

Here’s what the browser builds internally:

Document
│
└── <html lang="en">
    │
    ├── <head>
    │    ├── <meta charset="UTF-8">
    │    └── <title>DOM Learning</title>
    │
    └── <body>
         └── <div class="bg-black">
              ├── <h1 class="heading">dom learning from chai or code</h1>
              └── <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p> -->
