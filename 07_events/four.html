        /*setInterval() is a built-in function in JavaScript.
        It repeatedly runs a function or code block after a fixed amount of time (in milliseconds).
        Think of it like a clock alarm that keeps ringing after every X seconds until you stop it.

        In short:
        setTimeout() runs once,
        setInterval() runs again and again until you stop it.
        
        setInterval() is asynchronous like setTimeout().
        It does NOT block other code.

        After each delay:
        The callback is sent to the Event Queue.
        The Event Loop pushes it to the Call Stack when the main thread is free.

        Important:
        If the callback takes longer to run than the delay,js won't run them simultaneously, it will wait and might skip intervals.*/

        let x=1
        const change=function(num){
            document.querySelector('p').innerHTML+=`${num} ${x} `
            x=x+1;
        }
//code->> const nonStop=setInterval(change,1000,"num is") //can also pass third paramenet and can print it in funtionby passing a
                                                        //  parameter in function as do do here for num 

        //but it will run for infinite time so to stop this we will use clearInterval on stop button so when we press stop this will 
        //stop working

        document.getElementById('stop').addEventListener('click',function(){
            clearInterval(nonStop)
            console.log("clear interval ran on pressing stop button")
        })


        //Now we want it to get it started when we press start button ans stop when we use stop button (which we already did above)
        let nonStop;
        document.getElementById('start').addEventListener('click',function(){
           nonStop=setInterval(change,1000,"num is")

        })
