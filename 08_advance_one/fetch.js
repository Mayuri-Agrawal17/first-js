/*fetch() is a built-in JavaScript function used to make network requests (like calling an API).

It returns a Promise that either:
Resolves â†’ when the network request succeeds.
Rejects â†’ when there is a network error. 
*/

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
.then((response)=>{
    console.log(response)
})
.catch((error)=>{
    console.log(error)
})

//You will see a Response object, NOT actual data yet: Because fetch doesn't directly give you data.
// The server usually sends JSON (string format), so you need to convert it into a JavaScript object using .json().

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
.then((response)=>{
    return response.json() //Convert raw response to actual JSON data
    /*response.json() is specific to fetch and returns a Promise.
    It is like a combo of .text() + JSON.parse().
    Use JSON.parse() only when you already have a JSON string, not when working with fetch streams.*/
})
.then((data)=>{
    console.log("user data : ",data)  //Work with actual data
})
.catch((error)=>{
    console.log(error)
})

/*-------IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT FETCH()---------

1.Even if the server sends a bad response like 404 Not Found or 500 Internal Server Error, 
fetch() still considers it a resolved Promise â€” not rejected.

If the network itself fails (like no internet connection),
â†’ fetch() rejects and goes to .catch().

If the server responds, even with a 404 or 500 error,
â†’ fetch() resolves successfully because technically it did receive a response.

The designers of fetch() separated network errors from HTTP errors:

->Reject (catch block) â†’ Only for network-level issues like:
   -No internet connection.
   -Domain doesn't exist.
   -Server completely unreachable.

->Resolve (then block) â†’ Any response that successfully reached you,
    whether it's good (200 OK) or bad (404, 500, etc.).

2.why fetch() finishes before other task queue tasks like setTimeout()
1. First, understand the Event Loop

JavaScript runs in a single thread.
This means only one thing can run at a time.

To handle asynchronous tasks (like fetch, timers, etc.), JS uses a queue system:
Call Stack â†’ Where code runs right now.
Web APIs â†’ Browser-managed background area (e.g., fetch, timers).
Task Queues â†’ Where finished tasks wait to be run.
Event Loop â†’ A manager that decides what task to run next.

2. Types of task queues

Not all tasks have equal priority.
There are two main types of queues in JS:

Queue Type        |    Examples                                  |   Priority
Microtask  Queue  |	   Promise.then(), fetch() callbacks         |	 HIGH ðŸš€
Macrotask Queue	  |    setTimeout(), setInterval(), DOM events	 |   Lower

Key Rule:

Microtasks always run before macrotasks,
even if the macrotask was scheduled first.

This is why a fetch() .then() callback always runs before a setTimeout() callback.*/
