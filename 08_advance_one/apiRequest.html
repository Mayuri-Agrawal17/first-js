<!-- 
An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a waiter in a restaurant 🍽️.

You = The user (your JavaScript code).
Kitchen = The system or database where data is stored (like a server).
Waiter (API) = The middleman who takes your request to the kitchen and brings back the result.

APIs are important because they:
-Help different programs talk to each other.
-Allow developers to reuse services instead of building everything from scratch.
-Keep data secure, as you don’t directly access the database.
-Make apps dynamic — like getting live weather updates, stock prices, etc.

In JavaScript, APIs are used to get or send data from/to a server without refreshing the page.

In JavaScript:
-API request = Your order for data.
-API response = The data returned by the server.

Types of API Request Methods
These are also called HTTP methods:

Method	             Purpose	              Example
GET            	To fetch data	            Get weather info
POST            To send data	            Submit form details
PUT	            To update data	            Update profile picture
DELETE	        To delete data	            Delete a user account

*********************************************************************************************************************************

XMLHttpRequest (often called XHR) is a built-in JavaScript object that lets you send and receive data from a server, without reloading 
the whole web page.

It is the old way of making API requests before fetch() was introduced.

This is what made AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) possible.
AJAX = Update part of a webpage without refreshing.

Example:
You are chatting on WhatsApp Web.
Messages update in real-time, but the page does not reload.
Behind the scenes → APIs are used, and earlier this was done using XHR.


To make a request using XHR, you always follow these steps:

Step	    |   What it does	                          |     Example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create	|   Create a new XHR object	                  |     new XMLHttpRequest()
2. Open	    |   Set type of request (GET/POST) and URL	  |    .open("GET", "https://api.com")
3. Listen	|   Tell JS what to do when data comes back	  |    .onload = function(){...}
4. Send	    |   Actually send the request to the server	  |    .send()-->

        // Old Way: XMLHttpRequest (XHR)

        // Before fetch() existed, developers used XMLHttpRequest to make API calls.

        const xhr= new XMLHttpRequest()    //Creates an object to make the request. Purpose: Prepare to send and receive data.
        xhr.open('GET',"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1")  //Setting up the request."GET" → Type of request. URL

        xhr.onload=function(){         //.onload → A callback function that runs when the server sends a response back.
            if(xhr.status===200){       //xhr.status->Shows the HTTP status code.200 = Success , 404 = Not Found, 500 = Server Error
                console.log("Response:", xhr.responseText);  //xhr.responseText-Contains the actual data returned by the server.
            }                                                // Always comes as a string.
            else{
                console.error("Error",xhr.status)           
            }
        }
        xhr.send();                           //Finally, this actually sends the request to the server.

//****************************************************************************************************************************

        //Normally, server responses( xxhr.responseText) are in JSON format (JSON String).
        // We need to convert them to JS objects using JSON.parse().

        const xxhr=new XMLHttpRequest()

        xxhr.open('GET',"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")

        xxhr.onload=function(){
            if (xxhr.status === 200) {
                const data = JSON.parse(xxhr.responseText); //JSON.parse-> Convert JSON string to JS object 
                console.log("User List:", data);      //now here we will get the object in data
                console.log(typeof(data))            //o/p is object
                console.log(data[0])                //accessing 1st elemnt of object as the o/p is array of object
                console.log(data[0].address)        //now using dot we can access property
                console.log(data[0].address.city)   //we have property inside address also so accessing that
            } else {
            console.error("Error:", xxhr.status)
        }
        }
        xxhr.send()
